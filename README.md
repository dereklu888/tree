# cybersecurity-tree
Cybersecurity tree is a web visualization for the types of cyberthreats that exist in the world.

## About
Online and digital dangers are sometimes misunderstood. 

Many users, the same users most vulnerable to these threats, are unaware of the what these threats are. The cybersecurity tree, also called cybersecuritree, is made to teach others about these threats.  

## Design
Since cyberthreats naturally fall into a distinct category -- such as malware, PUPs, social engineering, etc. --, a tree was used to visualize these relationships.

Clicking on a node returns information about the type of threat.
