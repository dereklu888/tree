    <font face="inline" size="4" color="white">Although the growth of the internet and technology
      has influenced and enhanced many parts of our daily lives,
      it has also introduced risks and threats that can affect us in a multitude of ways.
      As part of our IB CAS project, we have created this website which shows different types
      of computer vulnerabilities represented in a visual web of points, in which each
      vulnerability is connected to its category, creating a web of different computer exploits.</font>
